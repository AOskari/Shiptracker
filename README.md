# Shiptracker

This is a school project for a web development course, focusing mainly in practicing the usage of APIs and creating a stylish and responsive web page.

We chose to use the Leaflet library along with the open JSON API by Digitraffic to show data of ships currently at the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland. 
OpenWeatherMap was used for showing basic weather information of the selected ship's area.
